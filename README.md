#Analysis of Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company
This is a Python-based project that analyzes customer churn data for a telecommunications company. The project is broken down into several sub-processes, each of which is designed to perform a specific task:

data_generator.py: Generates seeded data for the analysis.
data_cleaning.py: Cleans the data by removing duplicates and filling in missing values.
data_analysis.py: Analyzes the cleaned data by creating visualizations and performing statistical tests.
churn_prediction.py: Uses machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Additionally, a run_all.py file has been provided to execute all the sub-processes in sequence.

#Data
The data used in this project is stored in the data directory and is contained in the file customer_churn_data.csv. This file contains data on customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns, as well as a binary variable indicating whether the customer has churned.

#Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and several Python packages, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. You can install these packages using pip, the Python package manager.

#Usage
To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run run_all.py. This will execute all the necessary sub-processes in sequence to generate, clean, analyze and predict customer churn data for your telecommunications company.
